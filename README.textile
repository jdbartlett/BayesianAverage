h1. BayesianAverage plugin for CakePHP

This CakePHP plugin provides a Behavior that calculates the Bayesian averages of all items' ratings, in addition to the unweighted averages of their ratings.

*Cool. What?*

Let's say you have a book rating site. Two of the books are "Slaughterhouse-Five", and "I Love My Mommy" by some guy no one's heard of. "Slaughterhouse-Five" got 399 5-star ratings, and one 3-star rating. "I Love My Mommy" got a single rating of 5 stars by the author's mother. Because of Slaughterhouse's one 3-star rating, its mean rating has become lower than that of "I Love My Mommy", despite the fact that it has 398 more 5-star ratings than that book. In a list of books ordered by mean rating, "I Love My Mommy" would be considered "better" than "Slaughterhouse-Five".

This CakePHP plugin provides a Behavior you can use to avoid this sort of embarrassment by calculating what some call the "Bayesian average" or "Bayesian estimate", which weighs the mean rating of an item toward the mean rating of all items in proportion to the number of votes it receives in relation to the average number of votes an item receives.

h2. Basic Use

You will need tables that include the following fields, or fields like them. The table and field names don't matter, but you basically need a table for the items being rated and a table to store each rating, with at least these fields:

*items* table:
* id
* ratings_count
* mean_rating
* bayesian_rating

*item_ratings* table:
* id
* item_id
* rating

Then you need to include the Behavior in your model. You can specify the names of any fields that differ from the above structure:

  var $actsAs = array('BayesianAverage.BayesianAverageable' => array(
      'fields' => array(
          'itemId' => 'item_id',
          'rating' => 'rating',
          'ratingsCount' => 'ratings_count',
          'meanRating' => 'mean_rating',
          'bayesianRating' => 'bayesian_rating',
      )
  ));

The rest is done by magic. The ratings_count, mean_rating, and bayesian_rating will all be populated for you. When you want to order by rating, order by bayesian_rating instead.

h2. Increased Performance

An important aspect of calculating Bayesian averages is that the constant C and total mean m must remain consistent for all items. To this end, the behavior must occasionally recalculate the Bayesian averages for all items in your "item" model.

Every half hour (or half the lifetime of your app's default cache), we compare a freshly calculated constant C and mean m against a cache of those values. If the difference between the two is more than 10%, the freshly calculated values replace the previous cache and the Bayesian averages are updated for all items; otherwise, the cached values continue to be used for the next half hour.

You can escape the performance problem of occasionally having to recalculate all Bayesian averages by setting the value of the constant C and the mean m when you introduce the behavior from your model. For example, if you notice a trend that most items average about 50 votes and the mean vote is 3.5, you can set the values of C and m to be 50 and 3.5 respectively:

  var $actsAs = array('BayesianAverage.BayesianAverageable' => array(
      'C' => 50,
      'm' => 3.5,
  ));

Whether calculated or declared explicitly, if the value of C is 2 or below, the Bayesian average has no serious value. So that you can continue to order by the bayesian_rating field, the mean rating will be used instead.

h2. "Bayesian Average" Formula

The thing I'm calling a "Bayesian Average" might be better named otherwise. This is the actual formula I'm using:

  (n / (n + C)) * j + (C / (n + C)) * m

* C is the average number of ratings an item receives
* m is the average rating across all items
* n is the number of ratings the current item
* j is the average rating for the current item

I'm mot a mathematician. I stole it from the shoulders of Giants and was using it for some time before building this Behavior.
